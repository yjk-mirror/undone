[intro]
prose = """
The building has a buzzer panel with half the names missing. Yours isn't on it yet. You called ahead — last week, when you were still organizing the move, when the logistics were still the problem — and the landlord said come by Saturday afternoon, he'd be around.

You buzz the manager unit.

The man who opens the door is mid-fifties, flannel shirt, the kind of careful expression people wear when they've decided not to say the first thing they thought. He looks at you. He looks at the folder in your hand — lease printout, ID, first month's check, all the documentation you prepared because you knew this moment was coming.

"Robin?" he says. He means it as a question.

"Yes," you say. It isn't.

You hand him the folder. He opens it. The check is correct. The lease is signed in the right places. The ID is a valid driver's license with a clear photo of a white man in his early thirties. He looks at the photo for a moment longer than he needs to.

You give him nothing. You've done this before — meetings where someone says something wrong and you've decided not to correct them. The silence does the work. You wait. They fill it.

{% if w.hasTrait("SHY") %}
The silence lasts three seconds, which is two too many. "I know the photo's a little old," you say. It isn't what you meant to say, and now he's more confused than before.
{% elif w.hasTrait("AMBITIOUS") %}
You're already thinking about Monday. The landlord is documentation to process. You watch his face with the patience of someone who has sat across from investors who didn't read the deck.
{% elif w.hasTrait("CUTE") %}
You smile when he looks up. It's not calculated — it's a reflex. His expression softens slightly, and you make a note that you don't entirely like.
{% elif w.hasTrait("BITCHY") %}
You meet his eyes when he looks up and hold them. He is the one who looks away first.
{% else %}
You wait. He processes. From somewhere upstairs, the muffled sound of a television.

A pause. "Tell her the radiator in the bedroom takes a few minutes to warm up."

"Right." He looks at you. "The radiator in the bedroom takes a few minutes."

"Understood," you say.

He hands back the folder — keeping the check, obviously — and takes a key from a hook by the door. Unit 4B. Third floor, no elevator. He says the garbage is Tuesday and Thursday and the building has a no-smoking policy. You say yes, got it, thank you. He says welcome to the building, and seems to mean it.

You take the stairs.
