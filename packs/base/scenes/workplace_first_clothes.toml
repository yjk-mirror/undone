prose = """
She finds the department store by searching *bra fitting near me* and taking the result that has the highest rating and isn't a fifteen-minute subway ride. It's a fifteen-minute walk. Close enough.

Sunday morning. The store is half-empty, the good light from the tall windows hitting the displays. She takes the escalator to the second floor and follows the signs.

The lingerie department is in the back, which she's learned is always where it is, as if it's something the store would prefer to not have to acknowledge. A sales associate with reading glasses on a chain and an expression of total professional equilibrium looks up when Robin approaches.

"Hi. I need help with sizing."

"Sure." The associate looks at her — the practiced, clinical look, not the other kind — and names a section. "Starting there. Your measurements, or you haven't been fitted?"

"Haven't been fitted."

"Okay. I can do that. Two minutes."

{% if w.hasTrait("SHY") %}
Robin stands very still for the measurement. The associate is brisk and efficient and treats the whole thing with the detachment of someone who has done it several thousand times. Robin is still slightly mortified. She files this under *things that will be normal eventually.*
{% elif w.hasTrait("POSH") %}
Robin submits to the measurement with the awareness that she is in a department store rather than somewhere with a fitting room that has natural light. She doesn't say this. It's not relevant.
{% elif w.hasTrait("DOWN_TO_EARTH") %}
The measurement takes ninety seconds. Robin watches the associate write a number down. H cup. Same as she expected from last night's research. Good. Information is useful.
{% else %}
Two minutes is approximately right. The associate writes something and says "okay" and leads Robin to a rack with the specific efficiency of someone who has been told a number and knows where the numbers live.

She finds the department store. Nine AM. She is the first customer in the lingerie section.

She notes the things that are true. She doesn't editorialize. She has work on Monday.
