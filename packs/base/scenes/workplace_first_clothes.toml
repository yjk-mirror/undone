You find the department store by searching *bra fitting near me* and taking the result with the highest rating that isn't a fifteen-minute subway ride. It's a fifteen-minute walk. Close enough.

Sunday morning. The store is half-empty, the good light from the tall windows hitting the displays. You take the escalator to the second floor and follow the signs.

The lingerie department is in the back, which you've learned is always where it is, as if it's something the store would prefer to not have to acknowledge. A sales associate with reading glasses on a chain and an expression of total professional equilibrium looks up when you approach.

"Hi. I need help with sizing."

"Sure." She looks at you — the practiced, clinical look, not the other kind — and names a section. "Starting there. Your measurements, or you haven't been fitted?"

"Haven't been fitted."

"Okay. I can do that. Two minutes."

{% if w.hasTrait("SHY") %}
You stand very still for the measurement. The associate is brisk and efficient and treats the whole thing with the detachment of someone who has done it several thousand times. You are still slightly mortified. You file this under *things that will be normal eventually.*
{% elif w.hasTrait("POSH") %}
You submit to the measurement with the awareness that you are in a department store rather than somewhere with a fitting room that has natural light. You don't say this. It's not relevant.
{% elif w.hasTrait("DOWN_TO_EARTH") %}
The measurement takes ninety seconds. You watch the associate write a number down. Same as you expected from last night's research. Good. Information is useful.
{% else %}
Two minutes is approximately right. The associate writes something and says "okay" and leads you to a rack with the specific efficiency of someone who has been told a number and knows where the numbers live.

You find the department store. Nine AM. You are the first customer in the lingerie section.

The associate who helps you has done this for approximately ever and does not make a single thing about it. She measures. She says a number. She says *follow me* and leads you to a rack of options with the specific efficiency of a professional who has been told a size and knows where sizes live.

You follow. You keep your face neutral. Inside, you are taking notes.

You note the things that are true. You don't editorialize. You have work on Monday.
