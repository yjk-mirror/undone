Thursday evening, the grocery store two blocks from your apartment. You have a list. Two months of shopping here — long enough to know where things are and which checkout lane is fastest.

Thursday evening, the grocery store two blocks from your apartment. You have a list.

Two months of shopping here, and you're still making small adjustments. How you hold the basket. How you navigate around someone at the dairy case — the contact zone calibration that happens without being thought through, most of the time, but that you're still sometimes catching yourself on. You got here fine. You'll get out fine. It's the middle part that takes attention.

You move through the store efficiently — produce first, then the middle aisles, then dairy last to keep it cold. A man reaches across you at the pasta shelf with an "excuse me" that's more reflex than request. You shift slightly. He takes what he needed and moves on.

The contact zone calibration happened automatically. You moved before he asked, read the angle of his reach, cleared the space. Two months of this and it's close to instinct, which is either progress or just adaptation — hard to know which without a comparison point.

The whole thing takes fifteen seconds, and it turns out knowing where the miso is, and knowing you know, is its own minor satisfaction.
