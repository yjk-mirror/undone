prose = """
The bar two blocks from your apartment has a name — McAllister's, in faded gold above the door — but you think of it as the bar two blocks from your apartment, which is how locals think of places they actually use. Tuesday evening, the kind of quiet that means the after-work crowd has gone home and the late crowd hasn't started. Three guys at the far end watching something on the TV above the bottles. Two women at a high-top talking about someone. The bartender restocking.

You make the positioning call before you sit down. Bar stool or table. Table by the wall, or the one in the middle. The math runs fast: bar stool is easier to leave, easier to talk to people if it comes to that and you want it to. A table by the wall is solo in a different way — more purposeful, less accessible, the kind of alone that signals you're waiting for something even if you're not. The table in the middle is worse than both.

You take the bar stool.

You've been in bars like this from the other side. Ordered drinks and done the ambient scan — not the predatory kind, just the automatic kind — and not registered the women sitting alone except as data points. Available. Not available. Worth approaching. Don't bother. You didn't think about what the woman herself was doing with her drink, what math she was running, what she was hoping wouldn't happen. The read ran below thought. You didn't know you were running it.

You do the positioning math before you sit down. Bar stool: easier to leave, easier to manage on your own terms if something comes up. Table by the wall: more alone, less accessible. Table in the middle: worse than both. You take the bar stool and face forward and think about what it means that you're now the data point.

You order something simple — whiskey, neat, the universal signal for *I know what I'm doing and I don't want to talk about it*. The bartender doesn't interpret it that way or any way. She just pours it and sets it down and goes back to restocking.

The conversations at the other end of the bar stay at the other end of the bar. Someone scores on the TV and one of the three guys reacts and the other two don't. The bartender makes a comment from behind the bar that you don't quite catch. The evening does its thing.

In the intervals when business is slow, she asks something low-stakes — whether you live in the neighborhood, whether you caught what the score is. You answer in kind and don't encourage or discourage it. The conversation goes nowhere in a comfortable way. By the time you finish your second drink, the apartment sounds fine to go back to, which was the whole point.

{% if not w.alwaysFemale() %}
Somewhere in the second drink you notice you've been doing the thing without thinking about it: shoulders angled slightly forward, gaze on your glass, the particular quality of focus that reads as *occupied*, not *available, not waiting*. You learned it by watching. You didn't learn it consciously. It's working — nobody has tried anything, and you're starting to understand that this is not an accident, it's a skill. You just didn't know you were practicing it.

A man two stools down — mid-thirties, not unpleasant about it — asks if you want another. He does it directly, looking at you when he says it, which is something at least.

{% if w.hasTrait("CONFIDENT") %}
You accept. The conversation that follows is easy in the way conversations are when neither person has anything to prove — he's not particularly interesting, but he's not bad either, and the drink is free. You keep it brief and on your terms. When you're ready to go, you say something gracious and leave without making it complicated, and he takes it the right way.
{% elif w.hasTrait("SHY") %}
"I'm good, thanks." You say it to your glass more than to him, and for a second you think it came out wrong — too flat, or too abrupt — but he just nods and goes back to his drink without making anything of it. The relief is quiet and specific.
{% elif w.hasTrait("OBJECTIFYING") %}
You see the whole transaction very clearly: the scan he ran before he asked, the assessment, the decision to try. You've done the same math from this exact stool, from the other side of it. You accept the drink and give him a conversation about something he didn't come here to talk about — his job, it turns out, which he did not expect to discuss — and you leave when you've had enough. He seems satisfied with some version of the evening. You're not entirely sure which one.

You accept. The drink arrives and the conversation stays at the surface — the neighborhood, how long you've lived here, whether the food is any good. He moves on before it becomes anything. Fine.

The opening is a question about a bottle on the top shelf — something you don't recognize, short and wide with a hand-applied label — and she says it's a rye from a distillery in Vermont that the owner brought back from a road trip, which means she's heard the question before and has a practiced answer. You order it. It's good.

The conversation branches into nothing in particular, the way bar conversations do when both people are willing to let it go somewhere unplanned. She's got opinions about the neighborhood, about some renovation project two blocks over, about a regular she can't quite get a read on. You offer yours when you have them and don't manufacture them when you don't. An hour goes by without you tracking it.

You don't know her name by the end of it and she doesn't ask for yours, which seems right. You leave a good tip — enough to be generous without being weird about it — and walk the two blocks home. The apartment is quieter than when you left, in a way that's easier to be in.
