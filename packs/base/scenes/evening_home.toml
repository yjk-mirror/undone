Seven in the evening and nobody expects anything from you. The apartment is quiet in the ordinary way — not the wrong way, not the heavy way, just the low hum of a building going about its business and the light changing outside your window the way it does in late afternoon when the day has decided to wrap up without consulting you.

You have the whole evening. That's the situation.

The sofa. The kitchen. The phone on the counter with its three notifications you haven't looked at yet.

The evening is yours.

Seven in the evening and nobody expects anything. The apartment is yours for the night.

The free evening sits there slightly strange. You used to know exactly what shape evenings took when you were alone — the game, the playlist, the particular order of things that added up to not thinking about anything too hard. That shape has shifted without being replaced by something equally clear. You've been building the new routine incrementally, a few habits here and a few there, and the evenings are still the part where the scaffolding shows.

You've got the time. You'll figure out what to do with it.

You find something — a documentary you've had queued since whenever, or the third episode of that show you started a month ago and keep meaning to get back to. An hour becomes two without any particular effort. Dinner happens in front of it, without guilt, which is the correct way to eat dinner.

The apartment does its evening thing around you. Pipes, upstairs neighbor, the faint sound of someone's TV through the shared wall doing something with a laugh track. None of it needs your attention.

{% if w.hasTrait("ANALYTICAL") %}
Halfway through you find yourself working out the structure of the thing — the edit choices, the arc, what they're trying to do and whether it's working. You can't entirely turn it off. At some point this becomes thinking about something else entirely, which is fine. The screen is still there when you come back.
{% elif w.hasTrait("ROMANTIC") %}
There's a scene near the end that gets to you slightly more than you expected. Nothing dramatic. Just a moment that lands. You sit with it for a few seconds before the next thing starts.
{% else %}
It's a fine evening, and the notifications are answered at some point; you're not sure when.

You get into it properly. One of those stretches where the problem clarifies itself and you find yourself close to something you didn't know you were close to. You look up and an hour has gone, which is the best thing that can happen with an hour.
{% elif w.hasTrait("AMBITIOUS") %}
You finish something. Not a big thing, but a task that wasn't technically due and that you've been carrying around as a low-level irritant for two weeks. The particular satisfaction of clearing it is disproportionate to the task, which is exactly how it should be.

You lose track of time in the way that means you were actually present for it. By the time you surface, the light has gone completely and you haven't thought about anything you didn't want to think about for a couple of hours, which is worth something.

You spend the evening on your appearance without a reason for it — something with your hair, or the makeup you've been learning, or the outfit you bought two weeks ago and still haven't actually worn.

It's not vanity. It's something closer to practice — working out the register, what reads how, what you actually like versus what you assumed you'd like.

You stand at the mirror long enough to stop seeing a stranger and start seeing someone figuring something out, and that's enough for tonight.
