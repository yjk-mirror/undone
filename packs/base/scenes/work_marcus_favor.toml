The Slack notification lands at 2:07 PM: Marcus, with a link and a single line — "Hey — got 10 minutes to look at something?"

The link goes to a twelve-page infrastructure spec. You open it and spend thirty seconds skimming the structure. Section headers, latency assumptions, a rollback plan on page nine, a dependency diagram that's going to need to be explained to at least four people. This is not a ten-minute ask.

You send back: "Sure — give me a bit." He doesn't reply. He assumed you'd just look at it.

The Slack notification lands at 2:07 PM: Marcus, with a link and a single line — "Hey — got 10 minutes to look at something?"

You read the message twice. An ask, not an assignment. No deadline in it, no CC'd manager, no implication that this is already on your plate and he's waiting for confirmation. Just a colleague seeing if you have time.

You file that and open the spec.

Twelve pages. Infrastructure. The rollback plan is on page nine and is going to be a problem. You send back: "Sure — give me a bit." He doesn't reply. He just assumed you'd look.

You spend forty minutes on it.

Your comments are specific. The latency assumptions in section four don't account for the weekend load pattern — whoever wrote the benchmarks ran them on a Tuesday. The rollback plan assumes state recovery time that's optimistic by about forty percent under realistic failure conditions. And in section seven, there's an architectural choice that the rest of the team is going to dismiss on sight, and they'll be wrong to. You flag all three.

He responds the same day with three lines. Concedes on the latency section without argument — he knows. Concedes on the rollback timeline and adds a number to justify his original estimate that is, in fact, better than your number. Pushes back on the section seven note with a detail about how the data layer is actually structured, which changes your read of it.

Four messages total. You come out of it with an updated position on two out of three points, which is what a useful technical conversation produces. You close the thread and get back to what you were doing.

*This is what it used to look like*, you think, and then correct yourself — not used to look like. Still looks like. Same conversation. Different person in it.
