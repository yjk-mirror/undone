10:30, and the break room smells like burnt coffee from the first pot someone made at seven and forgot about. You're making your second cup — the machine grinds through its cycle, which you've timed to about forty seconds if you're not watching it.

Marcus comes in. He pours from the pot you just refreshed, doesn't thank the machine or acknowledge the timing, and turns to lean against the counter. He's looking at you like someone who already has a thought and wants to see if you have the same one.

"What did you think of Kevin's deck?"

Not *how did the presentation go*. Not *what feedback did you have*. He wants to know what you actually think. The space between the question and an answer is short — he's not giving you room to locate a diplomatic version.

"What did you think of Kevin's deck?"

You still clock the moment when someone asks your opinion as a first move — not the act of being asked, which is ordinary, but your own reaction to it. You've noticed Marcus does this. He asks the person in front of him things, and the person in front of him is currently you. You file the reaction away beside the others you're collecting, the ones you can't fully account for yet.

{% if w.hasTrait("ANALYTICAL") %}
Marcus's expression does something before the word arrives. You catch it — the slight compression, the exhale that stops before it becomes a sound — and you recognize it: he had the same read, and he was waiting to see if you'd say it. The "yeah" is confirmation of both things.

"Yeah," he says, and gets his coffee.
{% else %}
Marcus nods. Something in his face settles — not surprise, more like confirmation. "Yeah," he says, and gets his coffee.

The exchange takes maybe a minute. You take your cup back to your desk without needing to say anything else about it.

Marcus considers this for longer than you expected. Not stalling — he's actually thinking, the kind of pause that means the answer is getting assembled rather than retrieved. Then he gives it to you.

Two structural problems with the deck that aren't the ones you noticed. The first is a gap in the dependency mapping that won't matter until it does, which is going to be somewhere in Q3 and will be annoying to untangle. The second is a choice Kevin made in how he framed the migration timeline — technically accurate, but framed in a way that will mean re-explaining it to the same people in six weeks.

Neither of these is the risk section. You had the risk section. He had the other two.

"Okay," you say. "Thanks."

You take your coffee back to your desk with better information than you came in with.
