Unit 4B is empty.

You knew the boxes weren't here yet — the shipping company said Monday, which you'd confirmed, which means you knew — but knowing it and standing in an empty apartment with a carry-on bag and a body that has been awake for thirty-three hours are two different things.

The apartment is fine. The apartment is actually fine: pre-war floors, good light from the windows, a kitchen with actual counter space. There is a radiator in the bedroom. It's not on yet. It will take a few minutes.

You set your carry-on down and do a circuit of the rooms. Bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, living room. You note the things you need: furniture (Monday), bedding (you forgot this), towels (you forgot this), food (obviously). You mentally add items to the list and then realize you don't have anything to write them on, which means your phone, which means you open a note and start typing.

{% if w.hasTrait("AMBITIOUS") %}
The list is organized in twenty minutes. Priority-ranked. You text the shipping company to confirm the Monday window before you remember it's 11 PM. You send it anyway.
{% elif w.hasTrait("DOWN_TO_EARTH") %}
The list is practical. You don't overthink it. You've slept on floors before. This is not the worst situation you've been in.
{% else %}
The list gets long. You look at it for a moment. Add *bra* and then look at that word.
{% endif %}

Right. The bra problem.

You'd managed all day on sheer forward momentum — airport, subway, landlord, deposit — without thinking about the fact that what you're wearing under your shirt is not — you've been in this body for forty-eight hours and you'd been so focused on getting to the city that you hadn't —

*Okay*, you think. *New problem. Same protocol.*

Right. You don't — the list said *clothes*, generally, meaning Monday, meaning you'd had a vague plan to deal with *clothes* and hadn't extended that plan to include the specific practical reality of —

You sit on the floor — no furniture yet, the floor is clean enough — and look at the city through the window. The building across the street has lit windows.

Forty minutes later you have learned: bra sizing is a system that was apparently designed by someone who thought the metric system was too intuitive; that H-cup does not mean what you assumed it meant; that most department stores carry up to a DDD and then sort of stop; that there are specialty stores; that the specialty stores have names you're going to have to say out loud to a sales associate; and that you have, apparently, been categorically misunderstanding how underwire works for the entire time you've had opinions about it.
