Unit 4B is empty.

She knew the boxes weren't here yet — the shipping company said Monday, which she'd confirmed, which means she knew — but knowing it and standing in an empty apartment with a carry-on bag and a body that has been awake for thirty-three hours are two different things.

The apartment is fine. The apartment is actually fine: pre-war floors, good light from the windows, a kitchen with actual counter space. There is a radiator in the bedroom. It's not on yet. It will take a few minutes.

She sets her carry-on down and does a circuit of the rooms. Bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, living room. She notes the things she needs: furniture (Monday), bedding (she forgot this), towels (she forgot this), food (obviously). She mentally adds items to the list and then realizes she doesn't have anything to write them on, which means her phone, which means she opens a note and starts typing.

{% if w.hasTrait("AMBITIOUS") %}
She has the list organized in twenty minutes. Priority-ranked. She texts the shipping company to confirm the Monday window before she remembers it's 11 PM. She sends it anyway.
{% elif w.hasTrait("DOWN_TO_EARTH") %}
The list is practical. She doesn't overthink it. She's slept on floors before. This is not the worst situation she's been in.
{% else %}
The list gets long. She looks at it for a moment. Adds *bra* and then looks at that word.
{% endif %}

Right. The bra problem.

She'd managed all day on sheer forward momentum — airport, subway, landlord, deposit — without thinking about the fact that what she's wearing under her shirt is not — she's been in this body for forty-eight hours and she'd been so focused on getting to the city that she hadn't —

*Okay*, she thinks. *New problem. Same protocol.*

Right. He doesn't — she doesn't — Robin doesn't have one that fits. She'd been running on logistics all day and the logistics hadn't included that.

She sits on the floor — no furniture yet, the floor is clean enough — and looks at the city through the window. The building across the street has lit windows.

The food arrives. She eats on the floor. The radiator has warmed up.

She charges her phone, rolls her jacket into a pillow, and lies down on the floor of her bedroom. It's not comfortable. She's asleep in four minutes.

She opens her phone and starts searching.

Forty minutes later she has learned: bra sizing is a system that was apparently designed by someone who thought the metric system was too intuitive; that H-cup does not mean what she assumed it meant; that most department stores carry up to a DDD and then sort of stop; that there are specialty stores; that the specialty stores have names she's going to have to say out loud to a sales associate; and that she has, apparently, been categorically misunderstanding how underwire works for the entire time she's had opinions about it.
