[intro]
prose = """
Janette arrived at two with her parents and a cheerful willingness to talk that Camila managed for about forty minutes before inventing a reason to take a walk.

It's after midnight now. Janette is asleep on her side of the room, one arm over her face, breathing the steady rhythm of someone who went to bed at eleven without apparent difficulty. The dorm is not quiet — down the hall someone's doing something that involves a lot of muffled laughing — but Camila's curtains are drawn and the room has settled into its own dark.

She's been lying here for an hour.

The problem is the dream. Not the one she's having — she hasn't been asleep yet — but the one from the night before, and the night before that. She woke up last Tuesday knowing what she'd been dreaming and not being able to figure out what to do with the information. She'd been dreaming the way her body apparently dreams now, in the new grammar of this body, and she'd woken up with evidence of it and spent twenty minutes in the bathroom not thinking about it.

She's thinking about it now.

{% if not w.alwaysFemale() %}
*He'd made those jokes*, she thinks, and then corrects herself, and then makes herself sit with the correction. *She* made those jokes. The person in this body made those jokes. And now this body is responding to the exact category of person that those jokes were about, with the specific enthusiasm that she didn't know bodies could have, and she can't explain that to herself in a way that makes it make sense.
{% endif %}

Outside, someone laughs loud enough that Camila hears it through the wall. College. It's college. She's at college.

She knows what she wants to do and she's not going to do it because she's in a room with another person and she doesn't know what this means and she's not ready to know what this means. She pulls the blanket up. She stares at the ceiling.

The thing about shame is it doesn't argue. You can't reason with it. It just sits there saying *you know what this means* and you say *I don't know what it means* and it says *yes you do.*

She doesn't. She's not going to. Not tonight.

He responds in four seconds. *yeah, can't sleep either. college?*

She doesn't fall asleep for another hour. When she does, she doesn't have the other dream. She has a regular dream, about something forgettable. In the morning she decides this is neither resolution nor progress, just information, and she has orientation at nine.
