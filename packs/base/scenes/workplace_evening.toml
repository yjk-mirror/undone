[intro]
prose = """
The apartment is the same as you left it this morning.

You knew it would be. Apartments don't rearrange themselves. The awareness that this is not a thought worth having tells you you're more tired than you estimated. The bag goes on the chair. Your shoes go by the door. You're getting better at the shoes-by-the-door thing — you forget maybe one morning in three now, instead of every morning.

The city is doing its early-evening thing outside: delivery cyclists, someone on the third floor of the building across the street pacing with a phone, a bus pulling away from the stop. None of it requires anything from you.

{% if w.hasTrait("ANALYTICAL") %}
You do a brief audit. Day was a net positive: the PR got merged, the design review ran long but concluded, no one said anything that needed immediate correction. You gave feedback on two pull requests before lunch. Three items carried over to tomorrow. You know where each of them lives in the backlog.

The apartment is quiet. You don't have a read on the quiet yet.
{% elif w.hasTrait("AMBITIOUS") %}
You pull out your laptop before your coat is off. There's still two hours before you'd call it a reasonable stopping point and there's a follow-up you meant to send before end of day. You get as far as opening your email, read the first line of the thread, and then just sit there with your coat half-off and the laptop open.

The radiator ticks. You don't type anything.
{% else %}
You stand in the kitchen for a moment without particular purpose. Not hungry yet. Not ready to sit down. You put the kettle on, which buys you something to wait for.

You go to the bathroom to wash your face.

The light switch is on the right side of the door. You reach left on instinct — muscle memory from wherever, the old apartment, some room you haven't been in for weeks — and your hand finds nothing for a quarter-second before you correct. You flip the switch.

{% if not w.alwaysFemale() %}
{% if w.getSkill("FEMININITY") < 25 %}
The face in the mirror takes a second. Not because you don't know it — you know it; you've been looking at it for a week and a half — but the bathroom light is different in the evening and for one split second your brain ran the wrong comparison and came up empty.

*That's you.* The correction takes no time at all. It's just the gap before the correction that you notice.

You run the water cold. You wash your face. You've developed a particular way of managing the mirrors in this apartment, and you use it now.
{% elif w.getSkill("FEMININITY") < 50 %}
You catch yourself in the mirror mid-reach and hold there for a second. Not startled, exactly — you know the face. But the light switch thing and then the mirror thing in the same moment layers in a way that's harder to file away cleanly.

You run the water and wash your face and go back out to the kitchen.
{% else %}
You wash your face. The mirror is just the mirror. What catches you is the light switch again — the phantom reach that your hand still makes sometimes, corrected before it completes. You're going to be doing that for a while.
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if w.hasTrait("ANALYTICAL") %}
You run through the incident the way you'd run through a bug report: the switch is on the right, the instinct goes left, the instinct is a cached value from an input that no longer applies. The cache will clear eventually. No intervention required.

You dry your face on the towel and find this mildly insufficient as a resolution.
{% elif w.hasTrait("AMBITIOUS") %}
Two hours of work left and you're standing in your bathroom thinking about a light switch. The day had been productive. You'd been useful. You'd made things move. None of that is present in this room right now.

You grip the edge of the sink for a moment, then turn off the light and go back to the kitchen.
{% else %}
The kettle starts to rumble in the other room. You go back out to deal with it.
{% endif %}

{% if w.hasTrait("ANALYTICAL") %}
You make tea — the box of green tea you bought on Sunday because it was the familiar brand and you weren't prepared to make any additional decisions — and sit at the kitchen table with your laptop. Not working. You open a notes file and write: *light switch L→R. bathroom mirror. adaptation lag normal, cached motor patterns. no action required.*

You read it back. Close the note. Open the PR you'd been meaning to review.

You are not okay. But you are categorically operational, and the categories matter, and you've always found it easier to move through the world when you can name which category you're in.
{% elif w.hasTrait("AMBITIOUS") %}
You go back to the laptop. You send the follow-up you'd meant to send. It takes four minutes. The three carried-over items go into tomorrow's list in priority order.

When you're done you sit for a minute without doing anything. The city does its thing outside. You think about how the day went — specifically, accurately, without editorializing. It went fine. It went better than fine. You know what you're doing at this job, which is the one thing you were certain would survive the month intact, and it did.

You close the laptop and order from the Thai place down the block.
{% else %}
You make tea and sit with it by the window. The bus stop below has two people waiting. One is reading something on her phone; the other is just standing. The bus comes. They both get on. The stop is empty.

You drink the tea. The apartment is quiet in a way that's becoming, if not comfortable, at least familiar.
{% endif %}

{% if not w.alwaysFemale() %}
{% if w.getSkill("FEMININITY") < 25 %}
You would have ordered food and worked until midnight and not thought twice. Would have been fine.

You're fine. Categorically fine. You have a job and an apartment and a list and the list is getting shorter. The thing in the bathroom was thirty seconds of nothing and it's over.

You get up and start figuring out dinner. The city is outside. You are in here. Both of these are facts, and facts are manageable.
{% else %}
The switch thing was nothing. You know it was nothing. In a month you'll stop reaching left entirely, and at some point after that you won't remember that you ever did.

You get up and figure out dinner.
