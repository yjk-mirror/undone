The seat belt sign clicks off before you're ready.

You've been awake since — you do the math — thirty-one hours. The man in 14C reclined into your space somewhere over Ohio and you didn't say anything. You would have, before. The thought arrives without context.

The flight attendant crouches at the row ahead, smiling at something the woman there said. The aisle is narrow and people are already standing before they're supposed to, pulling bags from overheads with the focused expression of people who have not slept enough and have somewhere to be.

You stand.

The first thing you notice is the weight — you keep forgetting and remembering the weight, a rhythm you've been doing since Saturday morning and apparently haven't stopped doing. Forget. Stand up. Remember. The carry-on is in the overhead. You reach for it and a man behind you reaches past and takes it down.

"Got it," he says, and hands it to you.

He means it kindly. You know this. You say thank you and mean it, and file the interaction somewhere, and keep moving.

Through the jetbridge. Into the terminal. The airport is large and bright and indifferent in the specific way airports are: it has been processing people since before you got here and will continue after. The signs for Ground Transportation are adequate.

At the exit checkpoint, the agent looks at your ID. Then at you. The ID is correct. The face in the photo is a white man in his early thirties.

"I know," you say, before he can figure out the sentence. "I just look young."

The line behind you is long. He waves you through.

Thirty-one hours. You do the math like it's a ticket number and wait.

The aisle fills with people who have places to be. You have a place to be. You have a place to be and a job starting Monday and an apartment you've never seen and a body that keeps — you reach for the carry-on and a man behind you takes it down first.

"Got it," he says.

*Okay*, you think. You say thank you. You keep moving.

The terminal is large. The signs for Ground Transportation say what they say. You follow them.

At the exit checkpoint, the agent looks at your ID. The ID is correct. The face in the photo is not your face.

*Okay* — *okay*. There is a problem. Several problems. They are going to be solved in order.

The first problem is: you're in a city you don't know. The second is: the subway map looked fine on your phone but you need to know which platform. The third is: you've been awake for thirty-one hours and this body handles fatigue differently than you expected. Your hands are cold. They didn't used to get cold.

You find the platform. The train is three minutes out.

*Okay.*

You open your phone and request a ride. Forty dollars. You approve it without hesitation — you have a job starting Monday, you have money, and you have been awake for thirty-one hours and cannot read a transit map right now.

The driver is a middle-aged man who asks where you're headed and then doesn't talk for the rest of the trip, which is exactly what you needed. The city scrolls past the window. Brick buildings, a park, a stretch of fast food, then suddenly residential — trees, actual trees — and then the neighborhood the listing called "up-and-coming" and which looks like someone's about halfway through the up-and-coming.

The car stops in front of your building.
