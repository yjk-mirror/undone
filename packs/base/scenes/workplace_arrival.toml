The seat belt sign clicks off before she's ready.

She's been awake since — she does the math — thirty-one hours. The man in 14C reclined into her space somewhere over Ohio and she didn't say anything. She would have, before. The thought arrives without context.

The flight attendant crouches at the row ahead, smiling at something the woman there said. The aisle is narrow and people are already standing before they're supposed to, pulling bags from overheads with the focused expression of people who have not slept enough and have somewhere to be.

She stands.

The first thing she notices is the weight — she keeps forgetting and remembering the weight, a rhythm she's been doing since Saturday morning and apparently hasn't stopped doing. Forget. Stand up. Remember. The carry-on is in the overhead. She reaches for it and a man behind her reaches past her and takes it down.

"Got it," he says, and hands it to her.

He means it kindly. She knows this. She says thank you and means it, and files the interaction somewhere, and keeps moving.

Through the jetbridge. Into the terminal. The airport is large and bright and indifferent in the specific way airports are: it has been processing people since before she got here and will continue after. The signs for Ground Transportation are adequate.

At the exit checkpoint, the agent looks at her ID. Then at her. The ID is correct. The face in the photo is a white man in his early thirties.

"I know," she says, before he can figure out the sentence. "I just look young."

The line behind her is long. He waves her through.

Thirty-one hours. He — she — Robin does the math like it's a ticket number and waits.

The aisle fills with people who have places to be. She has a place to be. She has a place to be and a job starting Monday and an apartment she's never seen and a body that keeps — she reaches for the carry-on and a man behind her takes it down first.

"Got it," he says.

*Okay*, she thinks. She says thank you. She keeps moving.

The terminal is large. The signs for Ground Transportation say what they say. She follows them.

At the exit checkpoint, the agent looks at her ID. The ID is correct. The face in the photo is not her face.

*Okay*, she thinks — he thinks — *okay*. There is a problem. Several problems. They are going to be solved in order.

The first problem is: she's in a city she doesn't know. The second is: the subway map looked fine on her phone but she needs to know which platform. The third is: she's been awake for thirty-one hours and her body — this body — handles fatigue differently than she expected. Her hands are cold. They didn't used to get cold.

She finds the platform. The train is three minutes out.

*Okay.*

The train arrives with a rush of displaced air and a screech that the city has apparently decided is normal. She boards. The car is about half full — evening commuters, a man with a bike, two women talking about something that made one of them laugh hard enough to grab the pole.

She finds a seat near the door.

A man across the aisle notices her. Not aggressively — just the quick inventory, the two-second read, the look that slides away when she meets it. She knows exactly what he's doing.

She opens her phone and requests a ride. Forty dollars. She approves it without hesitation — she has a job starting Monday, she has money, and she has been awake for thirty-one hours and cannot read a transit map right now.

The driver is a middle-aged man who asks where she's headed and then doesn't talk for the rest of the trip, which is exactly what she needed. The city scrolls past the window. Brick buildings, a park, a stretch of fast food, then suddenly residential — trees, actual trees — and then the neighborhood the listing called "up-and-coming" and which looks like someone's about halfway through the up-and-coming.

The car stops in front of her building.

"Here you go," the driver says.
