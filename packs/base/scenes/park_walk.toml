Four o'clock and the park near your apartment is doing its afternoon thing. The dogs are making their rounds — a golden retriever pulling one direction, a pair of terriers pulling another, their owners attached like kites. A jogger goes by every few minutes on the outer path, steady as a clock. The sun is low enough now to come through the trees at an angle that hits everything sideways, turns the grass a color it isn't at noon. Nobody needs anything from you here and you pick a direction.

You do the full loop around the park — the outer path, past the dog run, past the fountain that's been turned off for the season, back around to the entrance. A man in a running jacket jogs past and nods without breaking stride. You nod back. The exchange is nothing.

You've given that nod before, from the other side of it. It's the same nod. What's different is how it arrives now — without the half-second sizing-up that used to happen below the surface. Just the nod, and then he's gone around the bend.

Jake comes around the corner with a dog — a medium-sized dog of uncertain breed, pulling in the direction of a squirrel with the full conviction of an animal that has never not caught a squirrel. He clocks you about two seconds before you could reasonably pretend you hadn't seen each other.

"Hey." He reins the dog in, not quite successfully. "Small world."

The dog decides you're worth investigating and that resolves the question of what to do with your hands for the next thirty seconds.

He's walking the whole loop, it turns out. So are you. The conversation that happens over the next twenty minutes is the kind that happens when two people are going the same direction and there's no particular reason to stop it. He doesn't make the meeting into anything — just talks, lets the dog set the pace, occasionally tells the dog to leave it. The dog does not leave it.
