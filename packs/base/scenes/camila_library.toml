The main library reading room has the specific quality of places where nothing is supposed to happen. High ceilings, long tables, the ambient sound of keyboards and very quiet conversation. She's been here twice already this week. She likes it here.

It's Thursday. She has a problem set due Monday and a reading due tomorrow. She's set up at the far end of one of the long tables — laptop, textbook, notebook, coffee in a spill-proof cup because she's learned — and she's been working for about forty minutes when someone sits down across from her.

She doesn't look up immediately. She finishes the sentence she's writing. Then she looks up.

He's about her age. Dark hair, serious face, the kind of jaw that you notice before you've decided to notice anything. He's opening a problem set that looks like hers — same course number at the top, she can see it from here.

{% if not w.alwaysFemale() %}
She registers all of this in about a second, and then she registers that she registered it, and then she looks back at her notes.

*Oh*, she thinks. *Okay.*

She is not ready for this. She was ready for the general concept, which she'd been processing for a week. She was not ready for it to arrive with a jaw and a problem set and sit across from her in the library at 3 PM on a Thursday.
{% else %}
She nods if he looks up. He doesn't. They work in silence, which is the correct library behavior.

Thursday. The library. She's been here forty minutes and it's going fine.

He sits down across from her. She finishes the sentence she's writing and then looks up. The sentence she finishes takes three extra beats.

He's in the same course. Same problem set. He doesn't look up from his bag.

She'd thought about this in the abstract. She'd been thinking about it for a week in the abstract. The abstract had the advantage of not having a face or a jaw or the specific way a person's hands move when they're opening a textbook.

*This is just attraction*, she thinks. *This is what attraction is.* She knows what attraction is. She's had it before, pointed in different directions, and it always felt like this: the registering before the reasoning, the body ahead of the thought.

The difference is just the direction. Theoretically.

She looks back at her problem set. Line six. She was on line six.

They talk through it for ten minutes. He explains the lemma. She already knew the lemma, mostly, but the explanation is useful and she doesn't correct him because it turns out she was missing a step. His name is Theo. He's in her section.

When she goes back to her problem set her face is doing something she doesn't have a name for yet.
