6:15 PM. The ceiling lights have shifted to efficiency mode — still on, but dimmer, the building's way of informing you that you are officially outside normal business hours. Most desks are dark. The HVAC cycles at a different register when it's only cooling the room rather than a roomful of people, and the air has that particular late-office quality: stale in a way that doesn't bother you anymore, quiet in a way that does, and the work tends to go better for it.

Head down. The work takes over the way it does when no one needs anything from you and the interruptions have all gone home. Two hours pass in a way that doesn't feel like two hours.

At 8 PM you close the laptop. The build is green. The spec holds up. Three tickets closed, one opened against a dependency you didn't trust when you first wired it in — and you weren't wrong. Good work isn't always satisfying in a legible way, but tonight it is.

{% if w.hasTrait("ANALYTICAL") %}
On the way out you pass a dark stretch of desks and a bathroom with a motion sensor that fires late, flooding the hallway with light for the three seconds it takes to decide you haven't stopped. The note you're carrying in your head — the calibration, the knowledge that a woman working alone in an empty office past dark carries a different set of considerations than a man doing the same — you've already run through it. The building. The route to the parking garage. The floor of the elevator. You made those decisions when you decided to stay, which is before it becomes an emergency rather than after.
{% endif %}

The night air outside is cold and clean, a significant improvement over the recycled late-office air you've been breathing for the last two hours.

Marcus is at his desk. You clock him on the way to the elevator — the overhead fixture above his workstation is one of the few still lit at full brightness, and he's leaning into a monitor with the posture of someone who has stopped noticing the time.

You're going to walk past. Then you don't.

"Deployment deadline?" you ask.

"Migration script." He doesn't look up from the screen. "Third time it's taken down the staging environment. I'm starting to think it's personal."

"Which table?"

He looks up. "Users."

"FK cascade order. If you're dropping and recreating, the foreign keys don't always run in the sequence you think they do." You say the constraint name. He stares at the screen for three seconds.

"Yeah," he says. "Yeah, that's it."

Two people in a half-empty office past six on a Thursday, talking about database constraints. Six seconds of actual communication — no performance, no navigation, just the work. Something in the frequency between you shifts — not attraction, just recognition. He goes back to his screen and you go to the elevator.
