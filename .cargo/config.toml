# Shared build configuration for the undone game workspace.
# This file is read by cargo regardless of which git worktree is active.

# Release profile: 16 codegen units instead of 1 roughly halves link time
# at the cost of marginal optimization — acceptable for a single-player game.
[profile.release]
codegen-units = 16

# Worktree build-cache sharing (optional, per-machine):
# When working across git worktrees (.worktrees/<branch>), all worktrees can share
# one cargo target directory so switching branches doesn't cause cold builds.
# Set CARGO_TARGET_DIR in your shell profile to the main repo's target/ dir:
#   export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/path/to/undone/target        # Linux/Mac
#   $env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR = "C:\path\to\undone\target"   # Windows PowerShell
# Do not set target-dir here — it would be machine-specific and break other devs.
