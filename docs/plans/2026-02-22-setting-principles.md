# Base Pack — Setting Principles

*Decided: 2026-02-22. These principles govern all content in `packs/base/`.*

---

## The City

A fictional city in the Northeast US corridor (Boston–Philadelphia belt in feel, not
geography). Not modelled on any specific city — close enough to be familiar, fictional
enough to own completely.

- **Regional anchor:** Northeast US. Dense, older, mixed-income, seasonal.
- **Name:** TBD — defer until writing guide session.
- **University:** Present. Creates student/academic-adjacent NPC and scene types.
  PC does not need to be a student.
- **Neighborhoods:** TBD — defer until writing guide session. Geographic specificity
  is optional flavour, not structural.

---

## Timeframe

Near-future. Unspecified date. All contemporary technology and infrastructure present.
No named precedents, legislation, or current events — the text should not date itself.

---

## Economic Strata

All four are viable starting positions and landing positions. The transformation may
move the PC across strata; both the before-position and the after-position remain
meaningful throughout.

| Stratum | Notes |
|---|---|
| Working class | Service industry, trades, hourly work |
| Student / academic-adjacent | University-connected, could be any age (mature students valid) |
| Professional / office | White-collar, middle class |
| Creative / freelance | Less stable, different social world, often economically mixed |

---

## Age

Full range playable. The age-delta between before-self and after-self is part of the
story — a 45-year-old in a younger body carries decades of context. This should be
used in writing, not papered over.

---

## Seasons

Four distinct seasons. Mechanically relevant to the scheduler (seasonal scene
availability). Atmospherically present in prose. Northeast seasons are real — not
"slightly cooler" but genuinely different quarters.

---

## Politics

The US political landscape around gender is present in ambient texture — in NPC
attitudes, institutional friction, neighbourhood dynamics. It is **not** a driving
plot force. The game does not take a position; it depicts lives being navigated.

---

## Differentiator from Newlife

This setting deliberately diverges from Newlife's British context:
- No British cultural references, idioms, or institutions
- US healthcare, legal, and social landscape instead
- Economic strata are US-specific (no NHS, different class signals)
- The Northeast corridor has distinct regional texture: seasons, density, diversity

---

## What This Setting Enables

- Range of social environments within one city (university, office, service industry,
  arts scene, working-class neighbourhood)
- Seasonal scene scheduling
- Age × class × before-sexuality × transformation-type as replay axes
- Political ambient tension without the game becoming a political argument
- A specific sense of place without being constrained by a real city's geography
