# Undone — World Reference

> Canonical facts about the game world. All content must be consistent with this document.
> Update this document whenever a new world fact is established in a scene.

## Setting

**City:** Fictional Northeast US city. Dense, transit-rich, economically stratified.
Resembles Boston/Providence/Hartford in scale and character. Two universities:
one large research university, one Ivy League (the city's Ivy).
Culturally: old money neighborhoods, working-class immigrant neighborhoods,
gentrifying artist districts, a financial district, extensive public transit.

**Time period:** Near-future, approximately 2028–2030. Recognizably our world with
small-scale technological and legislative differences. Never specify exact year.

## Technology and Infrastructure

**Airports:** The Northeast Privacy Compact of 2027 prohibited automated biometric
scanning at transit exits in member states. Airport exit screening is verbal/card only.
A customs or gate agent checks ID documents manually. This is how Robin and others
get through with mismatched documents in the first week.

**Phones/devices:** Identical to 2025. No new consumer technology to invent.

**Facial recognition:** Limited in public spaces by the Northeast Privacy Compact.
Still used in private contexts (workplaces, financial institutions) where opted in.

## The Transformation

**What it is:** Unknown. The game never explains it. Do not speculate in-world.
Others may or may not have experienced it — the game never confirms or denies this.
Characters who were transformed do not know of each other unless they tell each other.

**When it happens:** During sleep. Subjects wake transformed. No warning, no process.

**What changes:** Body completely. Skills, knowledge, memories: unchanged.
Personality: unchanged. Preferences, sexuality: may shift (character-specific).

**What doesn't change:** Name (unless player changes it). Job skills. Memories.
Professional and educational credentials (not yet biometrically enforced).

## Common Cultural Details

- **Transit:** Subway + bus network. Most characters use it. Uber/Lyft exist.
- **Coffee:** Dunkin' and Starbucks chains, plus independent cafés.
- **Grocery:** Stop & Shop, ShopRite, Trader Joe's, local bodegas.
- **Bars:** Dive bars, sports bars, cocktail bars. No Wetherspoons equivalents.
- **Food delivery:** Ubiquitous. Characters order in regularly.
- **Currency:** Dollars. "$5", "twenty bucks", "a hundred" — never British.

## Universities

- **The University:** Large public research university. 25,000+ students.
  Main campus in the university district. Liberal arts + STEM + professional schools.
- **The Ivy:** Elite, private, 6,000 students. Smaller campus, older buildings.
  Camila attends the Ivy. Socioeconomic mix: scholarship students and legacy students.

## Neighborhoods (establish as needed, document here)

- **Clement Ave area:** Walkable, mixed-use. Robin's apartment is here. Coffee shop
  on Union and Third.
