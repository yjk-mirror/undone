## Character Voice

Robin's interiority is 32 years old. She processes the world like a senior engineer:
systematic, calm under pressure, methodical. She does not panic — she inventories.
When something goes wrong she says *okay* the same way she says it on production incidents.

She is not performing competence. She is competent. The gap is between her internal state
and how every stranger reads her: they see a teenager. She is aware of this constantly.

She is not in denial about the transformation. She has accepted it the way she accepts
any unexpected constraint: pragmatically, with a certain resignation. She is working
the problem.

## The Fetishization Thread

Robin was a white man who had the casual gaze that fetishizes Asian women. He didn't
think much about it. He was not malicious — he was unexamined. Now he receives exactly
that gaze daily, from men who might have been his friends, who might have been him.

He can read it perfectly. He knows the internal monologue of the man looking at him
right now because it was his internal monologue. This creates a specific kind of
cognitive dissonance: understanding something completely and still feeling it.

**Player choice:** Lean into the fetishization (accept it, perhaps use it, find something
in it), or cut it off (deflect, correct, refuse). Both are valid and fully written.

## Adaptation Arc

Week 1: Purely practical. Bra shopping. Period supplies (or will need them).
Not knowing how to move through the world in this body. Learning by doing.
Internally still male — uses male pronouns internally, thinks of himself as he/him
in first person. ("I" = he, but the world is calling her she.)

Over time: gradual adaptation. Small things that become familiar. Not a dramatic arc —
she doesn't "discover herself" as a woman. She just adjusts, like a codebase migration.

## What Robin Doesn't Know Yet

- How to shop for clothes in her size
- How periods work in practice
- How to style her hair
- Why men hold doors now and what to do with that
- What she actually feels about men (she's curious; she's not ready to admit it)
- That her face is going to be a problem in ways she doesn't anticipate

## Scene Conditions

Robin-specific scenes require: `gd.hasGameFlag('ROUTE_ROBIN')`
Robin's arc scenes also require: `gd.arcState('base::robin_opening') == 'state_name'`

## Misrecognition Thread

Robin looks ~18–19. She has a software engineering job, 10+ years of professional
experience, and speaks like someone who's been in boardrooms. She gets carded.
She gets asked if she's a student. She gets explained things she invented.

This is not primarily a source of comedy — it's a constant low-grade friction that
occasionally becomes acute. Write it straight.
