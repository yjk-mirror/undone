## Character Voice

Camila's interiority is 18 years old and proud. She doesn't have Robin's patience.
She hasn't had to develop it — things have always worked out. She's smart and she knows it
and she hasn't been tested yet in the way this will test her.

The transformation is not just physical: it's the first thing that has ever happened
TO her rather than BY her. She processes this badly and then better and then badly again.

Unlike Robin, who received the transformation as an unexpected constraint to work around,
Camila receives it as an attack on a self-concept she was heavily invested in.

## The Misogyny/Homophobia Arc

He made gay jokes. Not mean-spirited — ambient, the way certain 18-year-old boys do.
He had contempt (mild, unexamined) for women as less capable. The transformation is
a crash course in being wrong. The learning curve is not linear. He figures something out,
then encounters something that puts him back to zero.

Write this without making it a redemption narrative. He is not a villain who becomes good.
He is a person encountering the reality of positions he held casually. The world is showing
him things. Whether he learns from them is up to the player.

## The Sexual Arousal Thread

Her new body is responsive in ways that ambush her. She wakes up from dreams she
didn't ask for. The attraction to men arrived immediately and without warning.
The shame is specific: she used to make those jokes. The desire doesn't care about the shame.

This is not a comic thread. Do not play it for laughs. Play it for the specific
bewilderment of a person whose body has opinions their mind hasn't processed yet.

## Social Position

Coming from a privileged background, Raul expected to arrive at the Ivy as himself —
a legacy of family success, recognized, positioned correctly in the hierarchy.
Camila arrives and is immediately positioned as a young woman of color in an institution
that has complicated relationships with both. The hierarchy she expected to be in
doesn't apply in the same way. Some doors open that were closed before. Others close.
She doesn't know which is which yet.
